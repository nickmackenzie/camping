## Day 1
---

We departed 5:30 in the morning to meet our 9 am shuttle at the outfitters to canoe lake. Spotting 3 foxes and a sly raccoon, we quickly got excited about the prospects of bigger and wilder animals. 

Arriving just before 9 with over cast with to the Algonquin outfitters Oxtongue lakes. This is one of the first outfitting companies in Algonquin Park and part of a legendary and gueling loop calling the “meanest link”. This would be our ending point on the river.

We paid for our canoe and were directed to behind the building to meet someone for our paddles and lifejackets. There we met Howard, a soft spoken and weathered man. We made short conversation and he got us fitted. Howard was also shuttle driver to canoe lake. Later we named Howard our canadian spirit guide or shaman. 

The route and general plan was to park the car at the outfitters get them to drop us off up the start of the river and paddle our way down.


Canoe lake greeted us with a usual overcast weather and dreary skies. That wasn't stopping us. A tradition and a good practice, we grabbed a huge breakfast at the Canoe lake restaurant and stocked up on last supplies. 

Pushing out from canoe lake is always an amazing experience.  It's such a bipolar place in the peaceful forest with buses pouring in and tourists swarming like ants. It's also a place full of energy. A place where there is common thought and that is “isnt this just fucking awesome?” A place where people are beginning and ending there journines. I love watching people come in and leave. See how they pack, how they act as a team and just the general excitement of leaving into the unknown. The people returning are interesting as well. The people who have been out there for a couple days. I like to see how rough they look or if they generally appeared untouched by mother nature. 

Today was no different, Canoe Lake was just starting to pick up so we quickly packed and made our way out. Lighting a celebratory joint and noting a rare no head wind in coming out into the wind, it was a great start to the trip. 


Making a slight detour around Canoe lake and eventually finding the start of the river we made our way down, noting the two other canoeists went down the same path.

The first obstacle was a man made dam with quick 150 m portage. Quickly gathering our stuff we made short work of the portage. This was the official start of the Oxtongue river. The river gave us some nice rapid to get steph acquainted with faster moving water. With every increasing difficulty, she would giggle with excitement. She awakened a white water beast and plans were quickly made to explore that avenue. 


The river was beautiful and mellow. It was narrow in places and wide and deep in others. It was never sparese with things to look at and gawk. The colors were absolutely amazing as well. Maples were in full reds and dogwoods were also changing. 

Coming up on the first campsites for the day, Steph and I were both glad about that. It was our first day and it was getting dark. The campsites were apparently on the portage trail and coming up on them they were both taken.

Trudging on we found another beautiful but small campsite at the end of the portage. 

This was also at the end of small to medium size set of rapids. We quickly agreed to empty the canoe and try to attempt them. Starting out with confidence and then someone screaming this is a bad idea!, we spun around sideways and were taking on water because we were stuck on a rock.. Quickly fixing the situation, we moved down into safer waters. Steph looked back at me and we both died of laughter.

It was getting dark so we quickly ate some pad thai, hung the bag and made camp for the night,.




## Day 2/3
---

Waking up in the morning was beautiful. Our campsite was at the bottom of some small rapids and came into a little pond. We quickly packed up camp, ate some oatmeal and move along. We wanted to put some distance between the groups behind us but soon the river had us gawking and exchanging the camera back and forth that they caught up and passed us. The river that day was amazing and with every bend it gave us an ever changing array of colors and sites. It had some obstacles from fallen trees and low river levels. Coming to a waterfall in the middle of nowhere was one of my highlights. Looking down the waterfall gave me jurassic vibes and was a beautiful sight followed by a 955 m portage that had steph and I battling our own demons on the trail. 

Eventually passing the groups with a new found energy, we made our way to a show stopping 40 m water fall and found the only campsite on top of the falls. Quickly setting up camp and going for a nice swim. We settled in for the night having beans and rice and chicken teriyaki. 

Finishing out the last day, it was raining when we awoke. Excited to try on our rain gear we packed up and made a treacherous portage down the falls. Heading out of the river and coming out into oxtongue lake, the outfitters was just a 20 minute paddle.
