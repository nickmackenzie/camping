## Day 1

***September 16th 2022***

I left at around 4:30 am on the Friday. I planned on meeting Dad at around 8:30ish.

A fairly uneventful and somewhat boring drive in the dark started my day. I remeber to hearing a song by the gorillaz featuring Beck and really appreciating it.

Ariving at the gate of Algonquin, I played my usual Hip selection.

I went to the Canoe Lake outfitters first becasue I arrived around 8:00 am. My water filter needed a new pump. 

I met Dad at Oxtongue Outfitters and we quickly got the canoe organized or what they call "checked-in". 

There was a Coffee shop in the parking lot of the outfitters.(Rise and Shine(?)) I got a espresso and I remember Dad asking 

```
"thats it?, how much did you pay for that?". 
"A couple of bucks"
"A couple of bucks for that thing??? I like sipping...Im a sipper"
```
Dad and I made a religious-like tradition and grabbed breakfast at the Canoe Lake restaurant. 
Both got the "Portagers Breakfast" which was a huge plate of eggs, bacon, ham, sauage toast, and hashbrowns.

```
"Over easy, white toast."
"Same."
"Easy."
```


Food was ok. Everything felt rushed and undercooked a bit. Not crispy. Eggs were just tolerable. Dissapointing but it came out hot and fast. Good to just have breakfast with Dad. 3/5 ***

We got on the water around 11 am. I quickly realized that the pace would be a much chiller tempo than the previous trip. Lots of stops and chilling. I liked it.

The river was fun and I remember lots of parts from the first time but alot of it was new. We did good on some "swifts" and even managed to not screw up in front of a family when going down some class 1's. 

Our first campsite was Twin Falls and we chose to camp on the first of 2 sites on the portage.A beautigul campsite with a complimentary river beside it. We set up camp and made some dinner. A boil-in-the-bag meal. Mexican style beef and rice bowel. Very good and delicious. 4/5

Starting a fire proved to a challenge with all the rain from the previous day had rendered all the wood at our campsite useless. Never the less, Dad managed to get a fire started, long after I had given up and cursed at a chipmunk for stealing my fire starter.

We had a good night but I packed it in at 11 while Dad stayed up and watched the fire.

## Day 2

***September 17th 2022***

We packed up camp and after having some hot cereal and apples.
Today was going to be a long day of paddling. It was a long day of paddling but we made it through. Theres not a lot of places to "pull over" on the shore to take a stretch break. We had to paddle through it. Plus it was both our first big canoe trips for a bit so our shoulders were espicially feeling it. I did feel great being out there though. I rememeber feeling very clear minded and extremely content. 

Finally arriving at the only campsite on the river past the park. I'm not even sure if its official, although there is a sign, although ragged. We set up camp and made some dinner.  Pad thai boil in the bag. Always a hit. 5/5

I was extremely tired and went to bed early.

```
"Maybe we can be on the water by 9 tomorrow?"
"We will see" 
```

Dad stayed up and watched the fire, but not as last as the night before. I remember thinking how sore I was, how good the pad thai was, and how much I loved being out there. It felt a little bit different and I cant quite pin the reasoning for it, but I felt really in tune with myself and it was refreshing.

## Day 3

***September 18th 2022***

Of course it was raining when I woke up, it probably woke me up. A typical Algonquin morning. It was actually pouring, like hard. Ah great, packing up wet. When I packed up the tent, it was laughably the wettest thing I have ever packed away. Like I had dunked it in the lake.
```
"You up?"
"Rain"
"Yeah"
"...."
"...Im packing up the tent"
```

We packed up camp and made some breakfast. Coffee in the pouring rain. 

Dad and I actually got in the boat at 8:45. Nailed it. 
Quickly approaching a 1000m portage. The falls are the nicest part of the whole trip and I made sure to take a picture of it this time and to stop and appreciate it.

```
"Wow, this is why you do this"
"Yup"
"Makes it all worth it"
"Yup"
```



Another hefty portage of 750m from ragged falls. A quick paddle down the rest of the river and we were on Oxtongue Lake. A little windy but I knew where to go this time so we made shot time to get back at the outfitters.

Drove back to Canoe Lake. Dad planned on coming down to see Jackson and hang out. We grabbed a later lunch at the "Oldest Outfitter in Canada" and I got a sausage and poutine. The sausage was cut down the center like the had to rush cooking it or something.  Poutine did use real curds. Gravy was flavourless but fries were suprisling on point and would have been better just on their own. 2/5
